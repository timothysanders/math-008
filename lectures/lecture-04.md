## Lecture 4: Values of the Unit Circle
- Radians: Length around the circle
- Angle: Rotation around the circle
- Radian: arc that is subtended (captured) by an angle
- Unit circle is very specific, its center is at the origin $(0,0)$ and has a radius of 1
- Unit circle formula: $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
- The $x$- and $y$-axis split the cartesian plane into four different quadrants
    - Quadrants one and two have positive y-values
    - Quadrants three and four have negative y-values
    - Quadrants one and four have positive x-values
    - Quadrants two and three have negative x-values
- For $\frac{\pi}{4}$, the x and y values are the same
    - You end up with $(x, y)$ coordinates of $(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$
