## Lecture 2:
- To go half way around a circle, we need $\pi r$ (r = radius). To go all the way around, we need $2\pi r$
- "Special radians"
    - Circle divided into
        - Two Pieces
            - Takes $\pi r$ (radians) to go half way around a circle
            - The arc is $\pi$ radians
        - Four Pieces
            - Takes $\frac{\pi}{2} r$ to go a quarter way around the circle
            - The length of the arc is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians
            - Three quarters of the way around is $\frac{3\pi}{2}$
        - Six Pieces
            - Takes $\frac{\pi}{3} r$ to go a sixth of the way around the circle
            - Each additional piece, $\frac{1\pi}{3}$, $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, $\frac{3\pi}{3}$, etc.
        - Eight equal Pieces
            - Takes $\frac{\pi}{4} r$ to go an eighth of the way around the circle
    - There are specific, unique points that we use for the unit circle
        - 12 equal pieces
            - Find unique radians that are not identified in the previous circle divisions
            - $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{5\pi}{6}$, $\frac{7\pi}{6}$, $\frac{11\pi}{6}$
