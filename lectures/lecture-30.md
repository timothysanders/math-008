## Lecture 30: More Vectors
### Vectors in Terms of $i$ and $j$
- A different way of denoting a vector is $ai + bj$
- $i$ and $j$ are what are known as "unit vectors"
- Unit vectors are vectors with a length of 1
  - Remember that 1 is our multiplicative identity
- $i = \lt 1, 0 \gt$: a vector of length 1 in the x direction
- $j = \lt 0, 1 \gt$: a vector of length 1 in the y direction
- The vector $\vec{v} = \lt a_1, a_2 \gt$ can be expressed in term of $i$ and $j$ by $\vec{v} = a_1i + a_2j$
  - In the equation, $a_1$ and $a_2$ are effectively scalars
- Remember that when adding vectors, we put the initial point of the second vector onto the terminal point of the first vector
### Horizontal & Vertical Components
- If we are dealing with a slanted vector, we need to use our trig functions to find scalars the help us figure out the overall vector
- To find the x component $\cos\theta = \frac{a_1}{|\vec{v}|} \to a_1 = |\vec{v}|\cos\theta$
- To find the y component $\sin\theta = \frac{a_2}{|\vec{v}|} \to a_2 = |\vec{v}|\sin\theta$
- Then, $\vec{v} = |v|\cos\theta i + |\vec{v}|\sin\theta j$
#### Examples
1. Given $\vec{u} = 3i + 2j, \vec{v} = -i + 6j$
   - Find $2\vec{u} + 5\vec{v}$
      - $2\vec{u} = 6i + 4j$
      - $5\vec{v} = -5i + 30j$
      - $2\vec{u} + 5\vec{v} = i + 34j$
   - Find the magnitude of $\vec{u}$
     - $|\vec{u}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{13}$
