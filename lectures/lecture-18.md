## Lecture 18: Trig Equations
- When we are given a radian or degree, we can find a terminal point
- When we look at inverses, we have a terminal point and need to find a radian or degree
- For trig equations, inverses are not involved, so there are no restrictions other than the original domain/range of the six trig functions
- Given a terminal point, how can we find a radian? We have to be careful, because the same terminal point can be found in multiple places/quadrants

#### Examples
1. $\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$
   - Here we don't want to apply the inverse property, because we don't want to apply the restrictions
   - This is asking us "where is cosine equal to 1/2?"
   - We know that it is positive, we know cosine is positive in quadrants I/IV
   - So we have a possible answers of $\frac{\pi}{3}, -\frac{\pi}{3},\text{ or }\frac{5\pi}{3}$
   - $-\frac{\pi}{3},\text{ and }\frac{5\pi}{3}$ are in the same position
   - We can keep rotating an infinite number of times
   - Break down our solutions into two parts
     - $\theta = \frac{\pi}{3} + 2\pi k; k \in \mathbb{Z}$
     - $\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} + 2\pi k; k \in \mathbb{Z}$
2. $2\sin(\theta) + \sqrt{3} = 0$
   - $2\sin(\theta) = -\sqrt{3}$
   - $\sin(\theta) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
     - This is asking us, where is the sine equal to $-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$?
     - Because sine is the y-value of the terminal point, this is the case in quadrants three and four
   - Break down into two parts
     - $\theta = \frac{4\pi}{3} + 2\pi k; k \in \mathbb{Z}$
     - $\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} + 2\pi k; k \in \mathbb{Z}$
3. $\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$
   - You can think of this as $\sin(A) = \frac{1}{2}$
   - As sine corresponds to the y-value, we are looking in quadrant I/II (where y is positive)
   - Radian $\frac{\pi}{6}\text{ and }\frac{5\pi}{6}$ give us $\frac{1}{2}$
   - BUT remember, $A = 2\theta$
   - $2\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6} + 2\pi k$
   - $2\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} + 2\pi k$
   - To solve for theta, divide every term by two
   - $\theta = \frac{5\pi}{12} + \pi k; k \in \mathbb{Z}$
   - $\theta = \frac{\pi}{12} + \pi k; k \in \mathbb{Z}$
4. $1 - \sin^2(\theta) = 0$
   - $(1 - \sin\theta)(1+\sin\theta) = 0$
   - Remember the zero product property
     - If $a \cdot b = 0$, then either $a=0$ or $b=0$
     - This means that either $(1 - \sin\theta)\text{ or }(1+\sin\theta) = 0$
     - $\sin\theta = 1\text{ or }\sin\theta = -1$
     - $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + \pi k$
5. $\sin\theta\cdot\cos\theta = \cos\theta; 0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$
   - $\sin\theta\cdot\cos\theta - \cos\theta = 0$
     - We can factor out the greatest common factor, $\cos\theta$
   - $\cos\theta(\sin\theta - 1) = 0$
     - $\cos\theta = 0$
       - $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}$
     - $\sin\theta = 1$
       - $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$
   - Solution set: $\{\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}\}$
