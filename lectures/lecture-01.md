## Lecture 1: The Unit Circle
- Equation of a circle
    - Standard form: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$
    - Center: $(h, k)$
    - Radius: $r$
        - Remember that radius is just $r$, not $r^2$
    - Unit circle is typically drawn right at the origin $(0,0)$, remember the center is $(h, k)$
    - The radius is a line from the center to any edge
    - Diameter has to go from edge to edge, through the center of the circle
        - Diameter is double the distance of the radius
- In trigonometry, we will be thinking about the angles that are created within the circle
    - Radians, etc.
    - "Initial side" vs "terminal side"
    - The initial and terminal sides create an angle
    - Will typically use $\theta$ to denote the angle being created
    - Angle will be described either as a degree or a radian (focus will not be as much on degrees, but rather on radians)
- Radian (plural "radii")
    - The length of the radius
    - Radian is used when we talk about the arc between the initial side and the terminal side. This is called "subtended"
        - The length of the arc is described in terms of "x radians", so "1 radian, 2 radians, etc."
- Pi
    - $\pi \approx 3.1415926$
    - We will be using pi as a value attached to a particular number of radians ($\pi \text{ radians} = 3.14 \text{ radii}$)
    - There is a special relationship between the diameter of a circle and its circumference
    - $\pi = \frac{C}{D}$ (circumference over diameter)
    - $\pi = \frac{\text{semi-circle}}{r}$ (half of a circle divided by the radius == 3.14...)
