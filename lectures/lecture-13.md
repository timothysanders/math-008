## Lecture 13: Inverse Examples
- The way we evaluate inverses is opposite to how we evaluate regular trig functions
- Instead of starting with degree/radian and finding a terminal point, we start with a terminal point and find the degree/radian
#### Examples
1. $\sin^{-1}(1)$
   - The argument is not a degree/radian, but it is a terminal point
   - Think "what radian gives me this particular input?"
   - You have to think about the restricted domain, in the case of $\sin^{-1}$ the domain is $[-1, 1]$ (our range from the non-inverse sine)
   - In this example, our answer is $\frac{\pi}{2}$
2. $\sin^{-1}(-\frac{1}{2})$
   - We need to check if our argument is in the range of the inverse sine function
   - There are multiple ways we can get to a $-\frac{1}{2}$ that is in our domain. In this instance the $-\frac{1}{2}$ that is in quadrant 4 is the only one that works
   - We cannot go around the unit circle, so instead we go backward (clockwise)
   - The answer here is $-\frac{\pi}{6}$ OR $-30^\circ$ (if you want the answer in degrees)
3. $\sin^{-1}(-\sqrt{3})$
   - $-\sqrt{3} \approx -1.7$, which is NOT in the domain
   - This evaluation is not possible because -1.7 is not in the domain of sine inverse
4. $\tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3})$
   - For inverse tangent, the domain is all real numbers
   - Tangent is negative in only quadrant II or quadrant IV
   - Remember that $\tan$ is $\frac{y}{x}$
   - This evaluates to $-\frac{\pi}{3}$

Evaluate the compositions
1. $\sin^{-1}(\sin(\frac{\pi}{3}))$
   - Make sure you keep track of which function is which
   - $\sin(\frac{\pi}{3}) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
   - $\sin^{-1}(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \frac{\pi}{3}$
   - In this example, we end up back where we started, but this is not always the case
2. $\cos^{-1}(\cos(\frac{5\pi}{3}))$
   - This does not lead us back to our original answer
   - $\cos(\frac{5\pi}{3}) = \frac{1}{2}$
   - $\cos^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{\pi}{3}$
